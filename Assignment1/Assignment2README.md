# DH150 Assignment 2 Usability Testing 

#### Purpose of Usability Testing

The purpose of the usability testing is to see what issues others find when trying to complete normal tasks, to understand if usability issues that I find are subjective or objective and gain a better understanding of what usability issues might come up for a typical user. What I wanted to specifically test with my usability testing of Breethe is how other users perceived its flexibility and efficiency, since in my heuristic evaluation, I found that it was not very flexible and efficient since it does not cater to the user's needs and make it easier for them to find specific meditations, so I wanted to see how it was for others to find a specific meditation. I also wanted to test how aesthetic and minimalist Breethe's website was, because to me, it did not look aesthetic and it also was not minimalist, since it included a lot of information that I thought might be irrelevant to a user. Lastly, I wanted to check for error prevention, because when I tried to create an account, there was no restrictions to what kind of password I wanted to create, and when I tried to change my password, there was no requirement to type my new password in twice, meaning that if I messed up when typing my new password, it would stay that way and there would be no way for me to know that I didn't type what I meant to until I tried logging in again. I wanted to see if others may think that this feature of Breethe is problematic.

#### Findings from Usability Testing

During the usability testing, my previous beliefs about the website being hard to navigate were affirmed. In order to find a meditation that a user wanted, there was no way to search it, and the user instead had to scroll through the long list of different meditations to find the one they wanted, which I originally thought was a very big issue with the website. I thought navigating favorites would be more difficult, since you must start playing a meditation to assign it to favorites instead of assigning it to favorites before clicking on it to play. Additionally, I realized I should have changed the instructions for the task where the user changes the password, so that the user changes the password to something with only lowercase letters or something that is very complicated so that they could see that there are no restrictions to whatever password they choose, and the website does not ask you to type it again, so it is very easy to mess up when typing a complicated password. Next time, I would give them more restrictions on the password they change to once they create their account, and have them log out and log back in with their new password.
