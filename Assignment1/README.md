##### Description about the community you want to contribute to with your UX Design: 

The community I want to contribute to with my UX design is the community of people that struggle to manage their mental health. Some of the most common struggles that people face when it comes to their mental health is handling stress, anxiety, depression and getting a good night's sleep. </small>

###### Brief information about the website

The website I chose for this project is Breethe, which is a website that has meditations to help people manage their stress, sleep or any other concerns about their mental wellbeing that they may have. The website includes series of meditations to achieve a long term personal goal, or single meditations meant to target an immediate issue. The website offers meditations for one's well-being, sleep and a variety of other concerns. Additionally, it offers meditations of different lengths and keeps track of the amount of time the user has meditated and the frequency that the user meditates. 

###### Overall evaluation of the website

Overall, this website has a lot of issues that makes it difficult for the user to easily navigate and use effectively. The website has quality content but does not make it aesthetic, easy to navigate or give the user a lot of freedom, making it frustrating for the user to use and turning them off from using the website. 



#### Heuristic Evaluation

###### Visibility of System Status (Severity Rating: 2)

The website does not do a good job of making it clear of what the status is for the user when they begin meditating. Once you start a meditation on the website, there is no quantitative indicator of how much time has elapsed in your meditation or of how much time is remaining in your meditation. There is only a bar, which provides a qualitative visual view for the user, which may not be helpful for someone who is pressed for time and needs to know their status.

###### Match Between System and the Real World (Severity Rating: 2)
 
The website has a good amount of match between system and the real world. In the website, the tabs are labeled “My Place,” “One-offs,” “Series,” “Well-being,” “Profile,” and “More.” “My Place” could be renamed to be “Home” as most other apps do to bring users back to the main page and the website has a “one-offs” tab that might be confusing, as they may be called “singles” to better match the real world, since “one-offs” is not a commonly used term. However, “Series,” “Well-being,” “Profile,” and “More” all match between the system and real world.

###### User Control and Freedom (Severity Rating:  1)

In the website for Breethe, the user control and freedom is satisfactory. For example, there is a clear “x” to help the user exit a meditation if they would like to, giving them more freedom and control. 

###### Consistency and Standards (Severity Rating: 2)

In the website, there is not too much consistency and standardization. The subtopics all look similar, since they all have grey font, and are the same size font and have a symbol. However, in the options within the subtopics, the options are all different colors, making them inconsistent and unstandardized. This can be confusing for a user, because they will think that the different options are of different levels of organization within the website, although they are of the same level.

###### Error Prevention (Severity Rating: 2)

In the website, the password for the creation of the account could have led to error prevention, but there was no parameters to the type of password that is allowed. Therefore, there is little error prevention in the website, but there is also few other factors of the website that may require error prevention. 

###### Recognition Rather than Recall (Severity Rating: 1)
	
The website has good recognition rather than recall features because when searching for a meditation to practice in a certain topic, like practicing mindfulness in the well being section, and within it, there are many different meditation titles to look at and recognize and choose that does not require a user to recall what type of meditation they would like to do. 


###### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (Severity Rating: 3)

The website for Breethe is a littl flexible or efficient for use, because there are shortcuts to get to meditations that may be more likely to be used by the user. For example, on the “My Place” page, there are sections that have the user’s favorites to quickly get to the user’s favorite meditations. Additionally, on the “My Place” page, there is a “Last Played” option for those that might want to repeat a meditation they recently did or continue a series that they recently started. These shortcuts on the home page allow the user to easily get to the meditations that they are more likely to use. However, these two features are at the bottom of the page in the “My Place” page, making it inconvenient for the user to easily get to the meditations they need. Additionally, there is no way for a user to search for a meditation, making it inefficient for a user that knows what they want, since they need to scroll through the list of meditations to find the one they want.

###### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Severity Rating: 3)

The website could use a more aesthetic design but it is fairly minimalist. In certain screens, the background with the rocks is dynamic and is moving, which may be distracting for the user. Additionally, the website uses many different colors, which is not an aesthetic look, since it would be a lot more aesthetic if they just followed one color scheme. However, the design does not have many unnecessary features or options, so it is a fairly minimalist design.


###### Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors (Severity Rating: 1)

The website does a satisfactory job to help users recover from errors, since there are not too many ways to create errors. However, if the user enters the wrong password, there is a message that helps them recognize, diagnose and recover from the error. 

###### Help and Documentation (Severity Rating: 1)

Breethe website’s help and documentation is satisfactory. In the help section, includes basic email contact information for questions, FAQ, billing, terms & conditions and a privacy policy. The FAQ section is organized into different concerns, such as “Account” or “Payments” to make it easier for the user to navigate and find an answer to their concern. Additionally, their documentation on the website is satisfactory because they add information on the founders, credits and a link to their blog, all which describe their process towards creating the website and offers additional resources. 


### Website #2

##### Information about the website/app I chose for this project: 

###### Screenshot of the web/app:

![Aura Screenshot](Downloads/IMG_5627.PNG)

###### URL of the website: 

https://www.aurahealth.io/

###### Brief information about the website:

The website I chose is called Aura and it is another meditation app created to combat stress and anxiety, and improve sleep through meditation.

###### Overall evaluation of the website:

Overall, Aura is a fairly user-friendly app since a lot of the concerns that users might have aren't severe enough that nobody will want to use the app. The biggest issue with the app is its lack of freedom for the user and lack of flexibility. If there was a way that users could use the app without having to give their payment information for the seven day trial and could exit that screen somehow, the website would be a lot more user friendly. 


#### Heuristic Evaluation

###### Visibility of System Status (Severity Rating: 1)

The visibility of the system status in Aura is satsifactory. For example, when completing the onboarding, it is clear what the user's status is in terms of how much has been completed and has much is left of the onboarding. Although the status is shows qualitatively and not quantitatively, I found it to still be effective. Additionally, when doing meditations, the app tells you how much time you have left in it, giving you the status of the meditation.

###### Match Between System and the Real World (Severity Rating: 1)

I found that most things in the app were a match between the system and the real world. All the words used in the context of the app would most likely be used in that same context in the real world, like "Life Coaching," or "Mindfulness."

###### User Control and Freedom (Severity Rating:  3)

I found that Aura had an issue with user control and freedom. For example, after completing the onboarding and making an account, Aura said you could use a free 7 day trial and then get a full year's subscrption to the app. However, you had to verify that purchase at the moment, and it would not let you exit that page until you paid. For users, who maybe don't want to see that page, even if they don't want to use the content of the app, there was no option to "x" out of that screen. This gave the user very little control and freedom and may frustrate users and turn them off from the app. Again, even after putting in payment information for the free trial and gaining access to the app, once I clicked on a meditation to use, I was given another screen that asked me to start my free trial without letting me leave that screen. 

###### Consistency and Standards (Severity Rating: 2)

The app is not as consistent and standardized as it could or should be. For example, for meditations that are of the same category but different, the background of them look fairly different, which can confuse the user into thinking the meditation they are doing is in a different category than the one they want. Although the labels for on the meditations for each category may be the same in meditations from the same category, the difference in background screens for the meditations being different may confuse a user. Additionally, all the meditations that you must subscribe for and the one's you can just do once are all together on the homepage and not standardized for their type in any way, which confuses the user. 

###### Error Prevention (Severity Rating: 1)

I did not find many issues regarding error prevention, since I did not find any features of the app that may have required error prevention. Since the app lets users login through an existing account through Google or Facebook, there was no need to prevent any errors in passwords, since those have already been prevented through Google or Facebook. Therefore, error prevention for Aura was satisfactory. 

###### Recognition Rather than Recall (Severity Rating: 3)

I thought there were issues with Aura's ability to use recognition rather than recall. There are a large amount of meditations on the app, all with very different and unique names. They are also not organized or categorized well enough for someone to quickly find a meditation they were looking for by quickly looking at one of the categories. In order to efficiently find a meditation that a user was looking for, they would have to search it up with keywords they remember. However, not everyone always remembers what they are looking for, making it difficult for the user to find a specific meditation they want to do if they can't remember it's name, which is a common occurrence. Therefore, this app relies on a user's recall more than recognition, making it difficult for the user to efficiently and comfortably use. 

###### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (Severity Rating: 3 )

I thought there was an issue of flexibility and efficiency of use for Aura. Before starting my meditation, there were around 5-6 popups giving me information about the meditation that was not particularly relevant instructions for which I had to press "OK" for everytime to continue. There was also no skip button to skip through them. For many users on a time crunch, this may be frustrating and annoying and be an inefficient use of time, thus decreasing the efficiency of the app. Additionally, if I have a meditation open ready to begin but I exit the app really quickly without closing the app, the app will forget about my meditation and take me back to my home screen, meaning that everytime I leave the app for some distraction, I have to spend the time looking for the meditation that I had previously opened, which is an inefficient use of the user's time. 

###### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Severity Rating: 2)

I thought there were issues with how aesthetic and minimalist the design for Aura was. The app is not minimalistic enough in my opinion, because it contains a lot of information, options or features that are most likely unecessary to the user and simply overwhelm them. For example, there are "Music Playlists for Every Mood" and "Top Life Coaching Channels" shown in the home Aura page, which are interests I never indicated having in my onboarding and thus, are irrelevant to me. Therefore, they make it difficult to navigate the home page since the home page contains more than the essentials and I must parse through unnecessary information. Although I do like the aesthetic of the fiery ring that represents Aura, I think all labels for the different types of meditations are colors that are very similar, as they are following the same color scheme, but they are too similar, which makes it confusing for the user to distinguish the difference. 

###### Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors (Severity Rating: 2)

I found that there were issues with helping users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors in Aura. For example, I tried to swipe from one meditation to another, but after swiping and the screen changing to the new meditation, it would take me back to the old meditation with no error message or reasoning for why. I was clearly making an error because it happened several times, but there was nothing showing up that was notifying me what the error was, why it was happening or what I should do to accomplish my task without producing that error again. 

###### Help and Documentation (Severity Rating: 2)

There is an issue with the help and documentation of the Aura app, as there is very little information for both help and documentation. For their help, they don't have an FAQ and just have a button that can be used for questions/feedback that opens up the "mail" app for the user to email them. In their documentation, there is little to no information about the founders or how they started or the development of the app. Instead, it just gives information of the fact that Aura is based in San Francisco and then gives their mission statement and website, which just gives information about the app.
