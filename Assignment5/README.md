### Scenario #1

Willow is back after a long day of teaching yoga. She comes home to cook dinner for fiance, who is on his way home from work. Once she finishes dinner, she realized she has some time to spare before he gets home, so she decides to meditate. She goes on the Breethe website to find a meditation. Once she goes on, she sees a playlist of recommended meditations for her, but none of them seem to be what she wants or the length she wants. She looks around through the website for something that will fit her needs, but before she can find one that is the right intent and length, her fiance gets home for dinner and she no longer has time to meditate now. 

### Scenario #1 Journey Map

###### Challenges to reach the goal:

Willow faces the challenge of having a time constraint to finding a meditation that fits her needs and completing that meditation.

###### Frustration:

Willow is frustrated because it is taking her a long time to find a meditation that fits her needs because everything is so unorganized and there is no filters or ability to search.

###### Possible Solution:

A possible solution would be to create labels for different issues that each meditation addresses and tag each meditation with the appropriate label. 

###### Action to Accomplish:

Willow goes to the section with all the labels and finds the one labeled “tired,” since she is tired and wants to find something that will help her with her exhaustion.

### Scenario #2

James just came out of a meeting when he got the text on his phone reminding him of the daily meditation he has to complete. Dreadfully, he goes back to his office to sit down in a quiet place to complete his meditation. He goes on the website and looks through to find one that is offered to him. He goes through all his recommended but all of them are much longer than the amount of time he has. He then goes through the list of meditations they offer and scrolls through all of them to find one that is his desired length of time, but this takes him a few minutes to find, and he has now wasted precious time that he needs to be productive. 

### Scenario #2 Journey Map

###### Challenges to reach the goal:

James needs to quickly find a meditation that is the 10 minute length that is required of him for his daily meditation.

###### Frustration:

He is frustrated because there is no way to filter out all the 10 minute length meditations to easily find one that fits his mood and schedule.

###### Possible Solution:

A possible solution would be to create a filter that allows him to find meditations that are only 10 minutes long, or to create some sorting function that allows him to see the shortest to longest length meditations and vice versa.

###### Action to Accomplish:

James would then choose to filter out everything except 10 minute long meditations from the type of meditation he is interested in, so he can more easily find it.

### Scenario #3

William was watching a movie, in which at the climax, one of the characters was shot dead. This brought back some war flashbacks for William, and he began to feel some PTSD. This led him to decide to try and meditate to help him cope with the anxiety and depression that was coming from this triggering flashback. He opened the Breethe website to try and meditate, but struggled to navigate the website to find a meditation that would help him what he was feeling. Once he finally found the list of meditations, he began to scroll through each and every one of them and read them to find one that suited his needs.  

### Scenario #3 Journey Map

###### Challenges to reach the goal:

William needed to find a meditation that would help him with the PTSD he was feeling, which required a very specific meditation.

###### Frustration:

He is frustrated because it is not very clear or straightforward how to navigate the website and he is unable to find a meditation that fits his specific need of coping with PTSD quickly.

###### Possible Solution:

A possible solution would be to create a search bar that would allow William to search up keywords, such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, stress or trigger to easily find a list of meditations that touch upon/address those concerns.

###### Action to Accomplish:

William would find the search bar which should easily be seen on the home page and easy to navigate to, and search up the keywords that addressed the struggles he was facing so that he could start working on coping with his PTSD through the meditations that are on the website.
