Minimalist Meditation 
DH 150: Keertana Namuduri

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 

The project is about making meditation accessible, easy to use, minimalist and quick to find. I wanted to help the community of people that suffer from anxiety, depression or just people that are struggling with their mental health. 

## Clear design statement: 

The clear design issue that it is difficult to find meditations that a user may want to do, since there is no filter or search and no clear sense of organization.
