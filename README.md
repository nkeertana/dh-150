Just Breethe 
DH 150: Keertana Namuduri

## Introduction 

The project is about making meditation accessible, easy to use, minimalist and quick to find. I wanted to help the community of people that suffer from anxiety, depression or just people that are struggling with their mental health easily find meditations that may help them with their struggles. 

## Design statement

The clear design issue is that it is difficult to find meditations that a user may want to do, since there is no filter or search bar and no clear sense of organization. Therefore, it is difficult for a user to organize meditations that they are interested in or like for themselves, or find meditations for themselves that they might want to use. 

## Competitor analysis

Overall, this website has a lot of issues that makes it difficult for the user to easily navigate and use effectively. The website has quality content but does not make it aesthetic, easy to navigate or give the user a lot of freedom, making it frustrating for the user to use and turning them off from using the website. During the usability testing, my previous beliefs about the website being hard to navigate were affirmed.

## User research

I learned that I have to be more specific with what exactly I want users to search for and find, or I need to give them more tasks, since the testing went by very quickly. I learned that people don't spend as much time on their searches and do not do a thorough search, which means it is important for there to be an effective and powerful search system for people to easily find what they want, instead of having to do a thorough search to find the same information. 

## UX storytelling

My three personas included a 25-year old yoga teacher, a 35-year old product manager, and a 68-year old retired veteran. The three solutions to the three scenarios include creating a search bar, creating a sort/filter function, and creating labels that the user can create and tag videos with.  

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation

I changed the graphical design to include more earthy colors and rounded/script fonts from my original prototype, as I wanted the meditation website to feel very free-flowing and nature-esque, since the purpose of meditation is to make you feel more calm.

## Low-fidelity prototype

To gain a better understanding of how I wanted to create my wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype to give me an idea of how to use different features and go about different scenarios that I created

## High-fidelity prototype

I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma of the Breethe website, which aims to provide users with meditations that they can easily find. I used my low-fidelity wireflow to first create the screens that I wanted to make, using overlays, as well, and then I added the menu bar and slowly added the different features, such as the search bar, filters button, edit labels button, etc. to the existing wireframes that may have been used. I then built off of the pieces of the screen that lacked interactivity and connected to them to other existing screens when I could to add as much interactivity as I could.

## Conclusion

Throughout this process, I learned that user experience design is much more than just creating an aesthetic looking app that users like looking at. UX Design would be nothing without the research that is done for it and the usability testing, so there needs to be many people that are looking at the product and putting in their input for you to create a useful product. Additionally, there needs to be a lot of thought put into the personas to understand the range of people that may be interacting with the product and how to cater to all of those needs. Therefore, my biggest take away is that the UI aspect of design is completely propelled by the UX Research that happens.
