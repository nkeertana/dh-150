### The main design challenge:

The biggest design challenge of meditation apps is making them so minimalistic and aesthetic that users are inclined to go on the app to complete a meditation but also can find a relevant meditation very quickly in order to waste the least amount of time to be able to spend time in their busy day to meditate. My project would support users by making the website more straightforward in the homepage and more aesthetic looking so that users are interested in using the website and can navigate through it quickly so that meditation can easily become a part of their daily routine. The basic need that is involved for this activity is belongingness and love needs, since meditation helps a lot of people that feel lonely, depressed or anxious. Getting over these mental health issues can help people feel less lonely, more loved and have a sense of belonging. The traditional/current solution to satisfy this need is going to therapy, which can be very expensive and time consuming, and finding therapists can be very difficult so it’s also inaccessible. Therapy being inaccessible and expensive can be improved through meditation apps, since they are generally fairly affordable to get and you can use them whenever you need to, so they are always accessible on your phone, instead of waiting weeks to try and get an appointment with a therapist. 

### Target users:

The target users are college students and adults, since they are the most likely to be feeling stressed, anxious, lonely or depressed. The target users would be people that are either struggling with their mental health or are simply interested in improving their mental health. The users would generally complete this activity in any quiet place that they can find, such as their bedroom or a grass field on campus. To complete the activity, the users would sit down in a quiet and isolated spot, find a meditation that they want to complete, close their eyes, complete their meditation, and open their eyes once their meditation is complete. 

### Observation Method:

I will be interviewing with participatory observation. 

### Context:

We will be meeting in the lounges in Sproul Hall. I will have the user search up the benefits of meditation and how meditation can help them. Once they have understood the background and have done the research, I will have them find a website that offers meditations. Then, I’ll have them look for a meditation that targets their specific needs. Then, I’ll have them start their search outside of the website and look for a meditation that fits that specific need only. I will interact with the user by introducing to them the goal of the design I’m studying and inform them that their user input will be helpful to gain a better understanding of how to accomplish this goal. I will collect user data through a voice recording.

## I will use this script as an introduction to my interview:

Thank you for participating!

We're not evaluating you in any way, but we're learning from you about how you look for information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'm asking in this study - we're simply interested in understanding how you do things online. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion - I will ask you to show me how you do things using this computer and ask you questions to better understand what you do.

Here's how the session's going to be scheduled. We'll ask you a few general questions about how you search for meditations online. Then you’ll go through the search tasks I have provided for you. While you are working on the search tasks, we'd like you to think out loud, so just give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind; don't worry about offending us since we didn't design this product.

I’m going to record a little audio of you so that I can go back and review things later and make sure we get everything right. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The audiotapes will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.
Do you have any questions at this point?

Could you tell us your name and tell us a little bit about what you do.

Where do you usually use your computer(s)? What for (email, work, watching movies, etc.)?

Is this the only computer you use? Do you share this computer with other people?

How much time / week do you use the computer? (In hours.)

Do you browse the web on your mobile phone? (if so, have you searched for information on your mobile phone?) (If so, remember to ask about this later on in the interview.)


#### Design Search Background

How often would you say you search for meditation-related information on your computer? (Don't prompt unless they get stuck. Then suggest "once a day? As much as ten times a day?" )


How well does that kind of search work on the computer? Do you usually have success when looking for meditation-related information?


What kinds of meditation-related information do you usually look up? What kinds of meditation information are you looking for? For you? For others you work with?


When you look up other kinds of meditation info, what kinds of things are you looking to find? Can you give me a few examples?

Which website do you use the most?


When did you first start using it? How did you hear about it?



#### User’s Own Searches

So, I’m going to ask you to do a few search tasks that are related to meditation. When you're doing these tasks, use whatever websites/tools you'd normally use, and please think aloud.

For this search, I want you to find a meditation website and a meditation audio/video that caters to your specific needs. 

How would you go about finding this information?

How long would you spend on a search like this?

Are you satisfied with the outcome of your search? How do you decide if you’ve found what you’re looking for?

Why did you choose this particular result? Can you say why it seems particularly good (or poor)?

Do you ever save the results of your searches? If so, how do you save it?

How well do these methods work for you?

Have you had any difficulty re-finding that information again?

For this search, I want you to find the benefits of meditation

How would you go about finding this information?

Do you ever save the results of your searches? If so, how do you save it?

How well do these methods work for you?

Have you had any difficulty re-finding that information again?

#### Problems with Searching Information

Have you ever had any problems when looking for a difficult design problem?? (Say, "I need to find a particular kind of plastic to use on a project" or “If only there were some software to help me with this problem…” )

How do you figure out WHICH of the alternates actually has design information you're looking for? (Any special tricks or techniques they use? e.g., going to another site, looking for associated images, etc.)

Do you use a social sites (forums or groups) to find design information or get inspiration? Do you search it, or do you just go directly to it? (Examples: Pinterest boards)

#### Different Kinds of Design Searches

Can you tell me about a research task that took you a long time?

Any searches for information that you find yourself repeatedly doing all the time?

Are there any kinds of searches that you do NOT attempt to satisfy using the internet? If so, what do you do in these cases?

#### Reflection

From this asssignment I learned that next time I conduct usability testing, I have to be more specific with what exactly I want them to search for and find, or I need to give them more tasks, since the testing went by very quickly. I learned that people don't spend as much time on their searches and do not do a thorough search so next time I would encourage a more thorough search to find the best answer to the search task.
