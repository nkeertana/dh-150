##DH 150: User Experience Design 

**Helping Users Increase Meditation**

Description about the community you want to contribute to with your UX Design: The community I want to contribute to with my UX design is the community of people that struggle to manage their mental health. Some of the most common struggles that people face when it comes to their mental health is handling stress, anxiety, depression and getting a good night's sleep. 

Information about the website/app I chose for this project: 
a. Screenshot of the web/app:
b. URL of the website: https://breethe.com/my-place
c. Brief information about the website:The website I chose for this project is Breethe, which is a website that has meditations to help people manage their stress, sleep or any other concerns about their mental wellbeing that they may have. The website includes series of meditations to achieve a long term personal goal, or single meditations meant to target an immediate issue. The website offers meditations for one's well-being, sleep and a variety of other concerns. Additionally, it offers meditations of different lengths and keeps track of the amount of time the user has meditated and the frequency that the user meditates. 
d. Overall evaluation of the website: Overall, this website has a lot of issues that makes it difficult for the user to 
easily navigate and use effectively. The website has quality content but does not make it aesthetic, easy to navigate or give the user a lot of freedom, making it frustrating for the user to use and turning them off from using the website. 



Heuristic Evaluation

Visibility of System Status (Severity Rating: 2)

The website does not do a good job of making it clear of what the status is for the user when they begin meditating. Once you start a meditation on the website, there is no quantitative indicator of how much time has elapsed in your meditation or of how much time is remaining in your meditation. There is only a bar, which provides a qualitative visual view for the user, which may not be helpful for someone who is pressed for time and needs to know their status. 

Match Between System and the Real World (Severity Rating: 2)
 
The website has a good amount of match between system and the real world. In the website, the tabs are labeled “My Place,” “One-offs,” “Series,” “Well-being,” “Profile,” and “More.” “My Place” could be renamed to be “Home” as most other apps do to bring users back to the main page and the website has a “one-offs” tab that might be confusing, as they may be called “singles” to better match the real world, since “one-offs” is not a commonly used term. However, “Series,” “Well-being,” “Profile,” and “More” all match between the system and real world.

User Control and Freedom (Severity Rating:  1)

In the website for Breethe, the user control and freedom is satisfactory. For example, there is a clear “x” to help the user exit a meditation if they would like to, giving them more freedom and control. 

Consistency and Standards (Severity Rating: 2)

In the website, there is not too much consistency and standardization. The subtopics all look similar, since they all have grey font, and are the same size font and have a symbol. However, in the options within the subtopics, the options are all different colors, making them inconsistent and unstandardized. This can be confusing for a user, because they will think that the different options are of different levels of organization within the website, although they are of the same level. 
	

Error Prevention (Severity Rating: 2)

In the website, the password for the creation of the account could have led to error prevention, but there was no parameters to the type of password that is allowed. Therefore, there is little error prevention in the website, but there is also few other factors of the website that may require error prevention. 

Recognition Rather than Recall (Severity Rating: 1)
	
The website has good recognition rather than recall features because when searching for a meditation to practice in a certain topic, like practicing mindfulness in the well being section, and within it, there are many different meditation titles to look at and recognize and choose that does not require a user to recall what type of meditation they would like to do. 


Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (Severity Rating: 3)

The website for Breethe is a littl flexible or efficient for use, because there are shortcuts to get to meditations that may be more likely to be used by the user. For example, on the “My Place” page, there are sections that have the user’s favorites to quickly get to the user’s favorite meditations. Additionally, on the “My Place” page, there is a “Last Played” option for those that might want to repeat a meditation they recently did or continue a series that they recently started. These shortcuts on the home page allow the user to easily get to the meditations that they are more likely to use. However, these two features are at the bottom of the page in the “My Place” page, making it inconvenient for the user to easily get to the meditations they need. Additionally, there is no way for a user to search for a meditation, making it inefficient for a user that knows what they want, since they need to scroll through the list of meditations to find the one they want.

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Severity Rating: 3)

The website could use a more aesthetic design but it is fairly minimalist. In certain screens, the background with the rocks is dynamic and is moving, which may be distracting for the user. Additionally, the website uses many different colors, which is not an aesthetic look, since it would be a lot more aesthetic if they just followed one color scheme. However, the design does not have many unnecessary features or options, so it is a fairly minimalist design.


Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors (Severity Rating: 1)

The website does a satisfactory job to help users recover from errors, since there are not too many ways to create errors. However, if the user enters the wrong password, there is a message that helps them recognize, diagnose and recover from the error. 

Help and Documentation (Severity Rating: 1)

Breethe website’s help and documentation is satisfactory. In the help section, includes basic email contact information for questions, FAQ, billing, terms & conditions and a privacy policy. The FAQ section is organized into different concerns, such as “Account” or “Payments” to make it easier for the user to navigate and find an answer to their concern. Additionally, their documentation on the website is satisfactory because they add information on the founders, credits and a link to their blog, all which describe their process towards creating the website and offers additional resources.
