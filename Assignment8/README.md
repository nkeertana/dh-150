## Brief Description

For my project, I remade the Breethe website, which is a website used for meditations. The three features/scenarios that I added were a search bar, labels, and a filter/sort option. In order to do this, I first created the home page and created the buttons that would be necessary to click on to move on to the next wireframe from my low-fidelity wireframe/wireflow. I tried to connect the prototype to where clicking on each thing would take you. 

## Graphical Design

Currently, the graphical design of the website is very blue and is many different hues of blue, since blue is a very relaxing color and when people are meditating, they want to be relaxed. However, I do think that there is too much blue, and not enough contrast, so I will be changing the graphical design of it so that there is more contrast, and the website can be more accessible. Additionally, I used a font that was sans serif for the title "Breethe" because it would be less rigid and more free-flowing, as one wants to feel when they meditate. I also tried to make the buttons have rounder edges to make it seem more relaxed, as well. After taking in feedback, I started making some changes to the graphical design, but didn't have time to fully change it, so I will be doing that in the coming week, but this change has better contrast colors, rounder buttons, and a title that is a script font to imply the free-flowing nature of the website.
